== Transliteration in Ruby

The ruby implementation is importing nnets components to run transformers
in ruby after they were trained and export with the python code/scripts.

===== Packages Installation
`
gem install optparse
gem install onnxruntime
gem install yaml
gem install tqdm
`

===== Transformer into Ruby

The code has just the useful part of the transformer implemented.
 A transformer is a complex architecture applying various neural networks
and here, only the encoding + "greedy decoding" + decoding were implemented.

The full transformer model can be trained and mapped into ONNX format with the python script
in ../python-nnets-torch.

===== Assets

load ONNX models can be
found https://github.com/secryst/transliteration-learner-from-graph-models[here].

The code uses ../config/model.yml for the path params.
By default, code searching for following files under ../resources:

  * vocab_transform.yaml
  * positional_embbedding.onnx
  * transformer_decoder.onnx
  * token_src_embbedding.onnx
  * transformer_encoder.onnx
  * token_tgt_embbedding.onnx
  * transformer_generator.onnx

===== Running code
Given the small train data, the code is replicating simple examples only.
