== Train and Export Transliteration Models

We are teaching transliteration farsi -> latine to neural networks.
For doing it, we use a modern framework: transformers

The code in this repository allows to train and export these Models
into the ONNX format that is in turn used in the production done in Ruby.

Paths would need to be adjusted, as this was a code running google collab.

==== Usage

We refer to QUICKSTART in main and farsi branches for examples.

* Parameters
In ../config/params.yaml
  relevant parameters are under: NNets

====== Run

* Run training
[source,bash]
----
python script_train_transformer_on_transliteration.py----

* Export Model into ONNX
[source,bash]
----
python script_transformers_decomposed_to_onnx.py
----
Output of above script is into  /resources.
