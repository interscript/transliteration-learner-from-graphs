= transliteration-learner-from-graphs

A technology to design transliteration systems from scratch, integrative
of language experts workflow with a graphical
editor.

We refer to the main branch for an introduction,
papers, a quickstart to the technology.

=== ISO Farsi

This is a branch specialised to ISO farsi.
The graphical model can be found under /learn-graph/resources/ISO-Strict.png

===== Run the technology

1. download models from https://github.com/secryst/transliteration-learner-from-graph-models/releases/tag/v1
2. Follow instruction in /lib

===== Build & Train Models

====== Build Code From Graph
Code can be built from /learn-graph

====== Build Transliteration Examples
Script can be built from /learn-graph

====== Train Transformers
With code in /python-nnets-torch.

====== Export pytorch model to ONNX
With code in /python-nnets-torch.
